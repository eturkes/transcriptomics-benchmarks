	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, the computation consumes a long time and large memory space. In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-eﬃcient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq dataset. Our benchmark showed that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-eﬃcient, and accurate than the other algorithms. Considering the diﬀerence of computational environment of users and developers, we also developed the guideline to select the appropriate PCA implementations.},

	abstract = {Single-cell analysis is a powerful tool for dissecting the cellular composition within a tissue or organ. However, it remains difficult to detect rare and common cell types at the same time. Here, we present a new computational method, GiniClust2, to overcome this challenge. GiniClust2 combines the strengths of two complementary approaches, using the Gini index and Fano factor, respectively, through a cluster-aware, weighted ensemble clustering technique. GiniClust2 successfully identifies both common and rare cell types in diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods. GiniClust2 is scalable to large datasets.},
